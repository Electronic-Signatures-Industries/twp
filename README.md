# Textile Wordpress Plugin.
With this plugin you can have an interface to IPFS, Libp2p and Filecoin from your Wordpress website using the Textile tools.

You can learn more about Textile from their official page: https://textile.io/

This plugin is what you need if you want to start using IPFS in a fast and easy way. Literally, you can upload files from your Wordpress website to IPFS and share it in your same Wordpress website. This will help you to persist and share your data in new and attractive ways.

Imagine that you are a Writer. If you have your book in PDF format and a Wordpress site, you can use this plugin to get access to IPFS and upload your book to a permanent source of storage, how cool is that? Your books will live forever as long as the network exists.

Using our plugin and the embedded Textile tools you can upload any kind of file to InterPlanetary File System. This includes videos as well. So no more limits imposed for your hosting provider, just use something better, like IPFS, Textile and our plugin!
